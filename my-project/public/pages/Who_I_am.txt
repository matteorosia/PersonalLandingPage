 * Welcome to my </color><color='purple'>Personal CV IDE</color><color='green'>!
 *
 * I first designed this app in Figma, then I developed it using React and Tailwind.  
 * Why did I create this project?  
 * Because I thought it would be fun and creative to present my technical skills 
 * directly inside an IDE </color><color='orange'>(Integrated Development Environment).</color><color='green'> :)

 * </color><color='yellow'>This IDE is interactive: you can edit the code directly by clicking on the files in the Explorer :D</color><color='green'>
