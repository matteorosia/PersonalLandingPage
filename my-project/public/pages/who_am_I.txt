I graduated from ITIS Q. Sella (BI) in 2019 with full marks (100 cum laude), and immediately after high school I enrolled at the University of Eastern Piedmont. 

At the end of 2020, I started working as a system administrator at Centrico (now Nivola) while continuing my university studies. 

In 2022, I was hired as a Software Engineer at Incas, Member of SSI SCHÃ„FER Group, where I currently work as a VB .NET developer. 

In December 2023, I graduated with a final grade of 96/110. My goal is now to work abroad or change italian city.
